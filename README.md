### My research
My research focuses on a truly fundamental human ability: **physically interacting with objects**. This critical survival skill provides an ideal testbed to investigate the mechanisms of multiple brain functions and the ways in which they interact in service of complex behavior. For example, studies of object manipulation provide a window into **perception** (object recognition, 3D shape, haptics), **learning & memory** (prediction errors, cost functions, representational units), **reasoning** (intuitive physics, tool use & design), and **social cognition** (action understanding). Accordingly, my work is motivated by the idea that the algorithms of general human intelligence were significantly shaped by the computational demands of skillful sensorimotor control in a world filled with an endless diversity of objects.

My commitment to this type of research path is sustained by my love of **interactive technology and data science**. When I'm not thinking about human brains and behaviors, I love to experiment with the latest trends in _3D graphics, interactive design, immersive virtual reality, haptic feedback, crowdsourcing, and machine learning_.

In my experiments, I try to blend these methodologies to design realistic but novel interactions with "virtual objects" (_i.e.,_ objects I've bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties). This approach has been broadly productive: it has allowed me to examine **basic components of object manipulation**, such as how we control the shape of our grip during grasping movements; it has served as a lens to explore **thorny theoretical controversies**, in particular the connection between real-time motor control and conscious visual perception; and it has revealed **new theoretical principles about sensorimotor repertoires**, demonstrating how multiple objects can be efficiently stored in memory.
