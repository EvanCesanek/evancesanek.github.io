### About my work
The goal of my research is to understand how humans learn to **skillfully interact with physical objects**. Object manipulation is an essential ability in daily life and can be devastatingly disrupted by illness or injury, making it an impactful topic in its own right. But, viewed more broadly, it's also an excellent model behavior for cognitive neuroscience because it naturally recruits many different types of neural processing _without sacrificing ecological validity_. Just scratching the surface, it's easy to see the involvement of neural systems for <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; 3D shape analysis<br>&bull; object recognition<br>&bull; haptic feedback<br>&bull; multisensory integration"><b>perception</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; generalization<br>&bull; prediction errors<br>&bull; cost functions<br>&bull; representational formats"><b>learning and memory</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; sequential planning<br>&bull; intuitive physics<br>&bull; tool use & design"><b>reasoning</b></a>, as well as <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; action understanding<br>&bull; gesture & pantomime"><b>social cognition and communication</b></a>. One of the big ideas motivating my research is that the algorithms of human intelligence have been significantly shaped by the computational problem of _adaptively controlling interactions with a great diversity of objects_.

The reason I started doing this work, and one the main reasons I've stuck with it, is that I have a lot of fun working on **interactive technology**. When I'm not thinking about brains and behavior, I do my best to keep up with the latest developments in **3D graphics, haptic interfaces, interactive design, VR/AR/XR, web-based research, and more**.

In the classroom, I've seen firsthand how incorporating these technologies in approachable, hands-on demos and projects can **draw out a desire to learn and practice science in students from all backgrounds**. To me, this is evidence that interacting with objects leads to knowledge that is uniquely flexible and expressive, explaining why it provides such a **strong foundation for active individual contributions**.

In my experiments, I blend these methodologies to create novel but intuitive modes of interaction with **virtual objects** (_i.e.,_ objects programmatically bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties). I've successfully applied this approach to address a range of questions at multiple levels of inquiry. In some of my work, I've examined the **mechanisms of behavioral and psychophysical phenomena** in sensorimotor tasks, such as how we shape our hands to interact with 3D objects, or how 3D motion perception is affected by internally generated predictions. In other work, I've engaged in thorny **debates in the philosophy of mind**, particularly regarding the relationship between real-time action and conscious visual perception. Most recently, I've helped develop a new perspective on the **computational principles of sensorimotor-repertoire learning** by demonstrating that objects are encoded categorically in motor memory.
