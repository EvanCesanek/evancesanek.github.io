### About my research
The goal of my research is to understand how humans learn to **skillfully interact with physical objects**. As an essential function of daily life — one that is often significantly disrupted by neurological injury — object manipulation is an important topic of study in its own right. But it's also an excellent model behavior for neuroscience in general because it opens a window onto the mechanisms of multiple brain functions, including  **perception** (object recognition, 3D shape, haptics), **learning & memory** (prediction errors, cost functions, representational units), **high-level reasoning** (intuitive physics, tool use & design), and **social cognition** (action understanding). Accordingly, my research pursues the idea that the algorithms used by the human brain have been significantly shaped by the computational problem of _adaptively controlling interactions with a nearly endless diversity of objects_.

I decided to focus on this field mainly because it's an interesting and scientifically productive way to apply my love for **interactive tech and data analysis**. When I'm not thinking about brain and behavior, I'm trying to keep up with the latest developments in _3D graphics, interactive design, VR/AR/XR, haptics, crowdsourcing, and machine learning_.

In my experiments, I blend these methodologies to create novel but realistic interactions with "virtual objects" (_i.e.,_ objects programmatically bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties). Fortunately, I've found success with this approach across a range of research questions. My work has examined **basic components of grasping and manipulation**, such as how we conform the shape of our grip to the 3D shape of an object. I've engaged with thorny **theoretical controversies**, like the relationship between real-time action and conscious visual perception. And I've contributed to the development of **new theoretical principles of sensorimotor processing**, for instance by illuminating the role of forward models in 3D motion perception, and demonstrating that objects are categorized into "families" in motor memory.
