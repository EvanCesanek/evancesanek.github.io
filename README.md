### About my research
I try to understand how humans are so good at **physically interacting with objects**. This essential, highly adaptable skill is a model behavior that serves a window to study multiple brain functions, tapping into **perception** (object recognition, 3D shape, haptics), **learning & memory** (prediction errors, cost functions, representational units), **high-level reasoning** (intuitive physics, tool use & design), and **social cognition** (action understanding). Accordingly, my work pursues the idea that the algorithms used by the human brain are significantly shaped by the computational problem of _adaptively controlling interactions with a nearly endless diversity of objects_.

I found my way to this research mainly through my complementary interests in **interactive tech and data science**. When I'm not thinking about brain and behavior, I love experimenting with _3D graphics, interactive design, immersive virtual reality, haptic feedback, crowdsourcing, and machine learning_.

My experiments blend these methodologies to create novel but realistic interactions with "virtual objects" (_i.e.,_ objects programmatically bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties). This approach has been broadly productive: it has allowed me to examine **basic components of object manipulation**, such as how we control the shape of our grip during grasping movements; it has served as a lens to explore **thorny theoretical controversies**, in particular the connection between real-time motor control and conscious visual perception; and it has revealed **new theoretical principles of sensorimotor processing**, for instance by illuminating the role of predictive internal models in 3D perception, or demonstrating how multiple objects can be efficiently stored in memory.
