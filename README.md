<h3>Computational Cognitive Scientist</h3>

My research investigates human sensorimotor function, often with a particular focus on **how humans learn to skillfully interact with objects**. Not only is object manipulation essential in our daily lives, it's also an excellent model behavior for cognitive neuroscience because it naturally recruits many different cognitive processes. Just scratching the surface, we can see the involvement of <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; 3D shape analysis<br>&bull; object recognition<br>&bull; haptic feedback<br>&bull; multisensory integration"><b>perception</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; generalization<br>&bull; prediction errors<br>&bull; cost functions<br>&bull; representational formats"><b>learning & memory</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; sequential planning<br>&bull; intuitive physics<br>&bull; tool use & design"><b>reasoning</b></a>, and <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; action understanding<br>&bull; gesture & pantomime"><b>social cognition</b></a>.

I'm always looking for innovative ways to apply interactive technology to the study of human behavior. For example, my research often combines **virtual/augmented reality, motion capture, and haptic interfaces** to create real and virtual object interactions in experimental tasks designed to address a range of questions in psychology and neuroscience. I also follow the latest trends in **data pipelines, machine learning, cloud computing, full-stack web development, UX research, and more**. In the classroom, I've seen how incorporating all of these technologies in demos and projects can motivate students from all backgrounds to learn and practice science.

I'm also the creator of the open-source <b><a href="https://www.github.com/EvanCesanek/weblab" target="_blank">weblab</a></b> package, which aims to help researchers develop, run, and analyze complex behavioral experiments on the web.
