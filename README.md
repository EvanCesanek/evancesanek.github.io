### About my work
I study how humans learn to **skillfully interact with objects**. The ability to manipulate objects is essential in our daily lives and can be devastatingly disrupted by illness or injury, making it an impactful topic in its own right. Viewed more broadly, it's also an excellent model behavior for cognitive neuroscience because it is universal among humans and naturally recruits many different types of neural processing. Just scratching the surface, we can see the involvement of neural systems for <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; 3D shape analysis<br>&bull; object recognition<br>&bull; haptic feedback<br>&bull; multisensory integration"><b>perception</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; generalization<br>&bull; prediction errors<br>&bull; cost functions<br>&bull; representational formats"><b>learning and memory</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; sequential planning<br>&bull; intuitive physics<br>&bull; tool use & design"><b>reasoning</b></a>, as well as <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; action understanding<br>&bull; gesture & pantomime"><b>social cognition and communication</b></a>. One big idea motivating my research is that human intelligence has been significantly shaped by the problem of adaptively controlling interactions with lots of different objects.

I'm always looking for interesting new ways to apply **interactive technologies** to the study of human behavior. I spend a lot of time keeping up with the latest trends in **3D graphics, haptic interfaces, interactive design, web-based research, UX, VR/AR, and more**. In the classroom, I've seen how incorporating these technologies in demos and projects draws out a desire to learn and practice science in students from all backgrounds. I believe this style of hands-on, active learning leads to flexible and expressive knowledge that enables students to make meaningful individual contributions.

In my experiments, I blend these interactive methodologies to create real and virtual object interactions. I've successfully applied this approach to address a range of research questions in psychology and neuroscience. In some of my work, I've examined the **mechanisms of behavioral and psychophysical phenomena** in sensorimotor tasks, such as how we shape our hands to interact with 3D objects, or how 3D motion perception is affected by internally generated predictions. In other work, I've engaged in thorny **debates in the philosophy of mind**, particularly regarding the relationship between real-time action and conscious visual perception. Most recently, I've been developing a new perspective on the **computational principles of sensorimotor-repertoire learning** by demonstrating how set of objects with different visual and mechanical properties are encoded in memory.

I also maintain the open-source <b><a href="https://www.github.com/EvanCesanek/weblab" target="_blank">weblab</a></b> project, which aims to help researchers develop and run crowdsourced behavioral experiments using MTurk and Prolific. **weblab** consists of a command-line interface for managing experiments, plus a core experiment library that streamlines the process of developing complex interactive experiments in performant modern JavaScript.
