### About my work
The goal of my research is to understand how humans learn to **skillfully interact with physical objects**. As an essential function of daily life that can be devastatingly disrupted by illness or injury, object manipulation is an impactful topic in its own right. Moreover, it's an excellent model behavior for cognitive neuroscience in general because it opens a window onto multiple brain functions, including  **perception** (object recognition, 3D shape, haptics), **learning & memory** (prediction errors, cost functions, representational units), **high-level reasoning** (intuitive physics, tool use & design), and **social cognition** (action understanding). My research pursues the idea that the algorithms of human intelligence have been significantly shaped by the computational problem of _adaptively controlling interactions with a nearly endless diversity of objects_.

The reason I started doing this work, and one the main reasons I've stuck with it, is that I love **interactive technology**. When I'm not thinking about brain and behavior, I do my best to keep up with the latest developments in **3D graphics, haptic interfaces, interactive design, VR/AR/XR, web-based science, and more**. In my experiments, I blend these methodologies to create novel but intuitive modes of interaction with _virtual objects_ (_i.e.,_ objects programmatically bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties).

I've successfully applied this approach to address a range of questions at multiple levels of inquiry. In some of my work, I've examined **basic mechanisms** of sensorimotor control, such as how we shape our hands to interact with 3D objects, and how 3D motion perception is affected by predictive internal models. At other times, I've engaged with thorny **debates in philosophy of mind**, particularly regarding the relationship between real-time action and conscious visual perception. In my latest work, I've helped develop new **computational principles of sensorimotor systems** by discovering that objects are encoded categorically in motor memory, a finding that is incompatible with all current models of motor learning.
