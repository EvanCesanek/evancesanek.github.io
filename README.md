### About my work
The goal of my research is to understand how humans learn to **skillfully interact with physical objects**. As an essential function of daily life, and one that is often significantly disrupted by neurological injury, object manipulation is an impactful topic in its own right. It's _also_ an excellent model behavior for neuroscience in general because it opens a window onto the mechanisms of multiple brain functions, including  **perception** (object recognition, 3D shape, haptics), **learning & memory** (prediction errors, cost functions, representational units), **high-level reasoning** (intuitive physics, tool use & design), and **social cognition** (action understanding). My research pursues the idea that the algorithms used by the human brain have been significantly shaped by the computational problem of _adaptively controlling interactions with a nearly endless diversity of objects_.

The reason I started doing this work, and one the main reasons I've stuck with it, is that I love **interactive technology**. When I'm not thinking about brain and behavior, I do my best to keep up with the latest developments in _3D graphics, interactive design, VR/AR/XR, haptics, crowdsourcing, and more_.

In my experiments, I blend these methodologies to create novel but realistic interactions with "virtual objects" (_i.e.,_ objects programmatically bestowed with specific visual/mechanical properties). Fortunately, I've found success with this approach across a range of research questions. My work has examined **basic mechanisms** of reach-to-grasp movements and 3D shape perception, such as how we shape our hands to match the 3D surface contours of objects and how internal models of physics affect motion perception. I've engaged with thorny **debates in philosophy of mind**, particularly regarding the relationship between real-time action and conscious visual perception. And I've helped develop new **theoretical principles of sensorimotor repertoires**, for instance by demonstrating that objects are categorized into "families" in motor memory.
