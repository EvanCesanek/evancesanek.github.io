I study how humans learn to **skillfully interact with objects**. Not only is the ability to manipulate objects essential in our daily lives, it's also an excellent model behavior for cognitive neuroscience because it naturally recruits many different types of neural processing. Just scratching the surface, we can see the involvement of <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; 3D shape analysis<br>&bull; object recognition<br>&bull; haptic feedback<br>&bull; multisensory integration"><b>perception</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; generalization<br>&bull; prediction errors<br>&bull; cost functions<br>&bull; representational formats"><b>learning & memory</b></a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; sequential planning<br>&bull; intuitive physics<br>&bull; tool use & design"><b>reasoning</b></a>, and <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-html="true" data-original-title="&bull; action understanding<br>&bull; gesture & pantomime"><b>social cognition</b></a>.

I'm always looking for interesting new ways to apply **interactive technology** to the study of human behavior and trying to keep up with the latest trends in **3D graphics, haptic interfaces, motion capture, crowdsourcing, cloud computing, UX design, virtual/augmented reality, machine learning, web development, and more**. I blend these techniques to create real and virtual object interactions in experiments designed to address a range of research questions in psychology and neuroscience. In the classroom, I've seen how incorporating these technologies in demos and projects draws out a desire to learn and practice science in students from all backgrounds.

I'm also the creator of the open-source <b><a href="https://www.github.com/EvanCesanek/weblab" target="_blank">weblab</a></b> package, which aims to help researchers develop, run, and analyze complex behavioral experiments on the web.
